        <ul class="font" style="text-align: justify">
          Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie (Indonesian: [baxaˈrudːin ˈjusuf haˈbibi] ;
          25 June 1936 – 11 September 2019) was an Indonesian engineer and
          politician who was the third president of Indonesia from 1998 to 1999.
          Less than three months after his inauguration as the seventh vice
          president in March 1998, he succeeded Suharto who resigned after 31
          years in office. His presidency is seen as a landmark and transition
          to the Reformation era. Upon becoming president, he liberalized
          Indonesia's press and political party laws, and held an early
          democratic election three years sooner than scheduled, which resulted
          in the end of his presidency. His 517-day presidency and 71-day vice
          presidency are the shortest in the country's history.
